# yportne

`yportne` is the reverse of the word entropy, we all know what entropy means. But this point inspired by movie Tenet, and I write some statement in [here](https://github.com/i0Ek3/p0ints/blob/master/2020.1002-yportne.md). Maybe we need a backward data structure like this, funny enough. But I have no whole buleprint, instead of I just have some points. I will string these points together with creative actions.
